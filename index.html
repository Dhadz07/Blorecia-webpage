      <h2>THREE NATIVE TREES OF THE PHILIPPINES</h2>
      <br><br>

      <h3>Pterocarpus indicus (Narra)</h3>
      <a href="narra.jpg"> <img src="narra.jpg" alt="Image" class="img-fluid responsive-image"></a>
      <br>
      <p>The Narra tree, native to the Philippines, holds the honor of being the national tree. As a hardwood species, also known as Burmese rosewood, its purplish timber and rosewood scent make it highly valued in the furniture industry. Standing tall at 98-131 feet with a massive buttressed crown, a 6.5 feet diameter trunk, and taking centuries to reach maturity, the Narra dominates low to medium-altitude forests. Unfortunately, due to forest clearance, it faces endangerment, with populations seriously threatened. Declared the national tree in 1934, its significance extends beyond its ecological role to embody cultural and historical importance in the Philippine landscape.</p>

      <br>
      <p>Ylang-ylang (Cananga odorata) is a tropical tree with glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of intensely fragrant flowers. The flowers are star-shaped and come in varying shades of yellow. Known for its sweet, floral scent, ylang-ylang is often used in the production of perfumes and essential oils. The fragrance is rich and exotic, with hints of jasmine and neroli. Additionally, the oil is believed to have calming and relaxing properties in aromatherapy.</p>

      <h3>BOMBOX CEIBA(mabulaklak)</h3>
      <a href="bombox.jpg"> <img src="bombox.jpg" alt="Image" class="img-fluid responsive-image"></a>
      <br>
      <p>Bombax ceiba, commonly known as the silk cotton tree or kapok tree, is a large deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Asia. Here's a description:
      The tree features a tall, straight trunk that can reach impressive heights. Its bark is grayish and becomes ridged with age. During the dry season, the tree sheds its leaves, and large, green, compound leaves reappear during the wet season. The most notable characteristic of Bombax ceiba is its striking red or orange flowers, which are large and cup-shaped. These flowers give way to large, spherical fruit capsules filled with fluffy, cotton-like fibers. The kapok fibers have been traditionally used for various purposes, including stuffing pillows and life jackets due to their buoyancy. The silk cotton tree is often found in tropical forests and is culturally significant in various regions where it grows.</p>
